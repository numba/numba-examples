    "Most modern CPUs have support for instructions that apply the same operation to multiple data elements simultaneously.  These are called \"Single Instruction, Multiple Data\" (SIMD) operations, and the LLVM backend used by Numba can generate them in some cases to execute loops more quickly.  (This process is called \"autovectorization.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Intel processors have support for SIMD instruction sets like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SSE (128-bit inputs)\n",
    "* AVX (256-bit inputs)\n",
    "* AVX-512 (512-bit inputs, Skylake-X and later or Xeon Phi)\n",
    "\n",
    "These wide instructions typically operate on as many values as will fit into an input register.  For AVX instructions, this means that either 8 float32 values or 4 float64 values can be processed as a single input.  As a result, the NumPy dtype that you use can potentially impact performance to a greater degree than when SIMD is not in use."

    "It can be somewhat tricky to determine when LLVM has successfully autovectorized a loop.  The Numba team is working on exporting diagnostic information to show where the autovectorizer has generated SIMD code.  For now, we can use a fairly crude approach of searching the assembly language generated by LLVM for SIMD instructions.  On x86_64, the AVX registers are named `ymmX`, where X is an integer, so we can write a function to search the assembly language of a compiled function for instances of `ymm` and print them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This particular approach for finding SIMD instructions will only work on Intel/AMD CPUs where AVX instructions will be generated.  If you are using a very recent, high-end Intel processor, you may get AVX-512 instructions, which refer to `zmm` registers instead of `ymm`. Other platforms have entirely different assembly language syntax for SIMD instructions."
