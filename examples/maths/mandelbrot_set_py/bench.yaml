name: Mandelbrot Set (Pure Python)
description: |
    Compute the Mandelbrot Set, a set of points on the complex plane which always remain bounded by a threshold value while solving the quadratic recurrence equation. It is an iterative problem which is also compute intensive and visual in nature.  
    In this benchmark we learn how numba can accelerate the pure python code for mandelbrot set computation.
